## Getting Started

`make build`

Builds the app into the `/build` folder.

### Frontend

## Overview

The frontend is built in React using MaterialUI. It is integrated with the backend using [lorca](https://github.com/zserge/lorca).

## Serial Port

We use https://godoc.org/github.com/tarm/serial for our serial communications.

Currently all ports are opened with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no hardware flow control, and no software flow control.

### Fake Port

For better testing, a fake serial port has been implemented to enable testing. When COM Port 999 is selected, the fake serial port is used.
